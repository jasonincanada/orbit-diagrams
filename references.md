Most concepts in these images are basic category theory and function calculus that I've absorbed over the years from various sources and from working with them in Haskell projects. The following are references to specific places I saw a concept for the first time:


### state-s-store-s-pairing.png

The state/store pairing concept is from page 26 (bottom) of this thesis by Arthur Xavier:

### continuation-passing-style-monad-bind.png

This is the monad instance, using the `bind` method, of the continuation-passing functor, from page 1 of this paper:
